            <h2>What is soil?</h2>
            <h1>Soil is a natural resource that covers most of the Earth's land and is made up of minerals, organic matter, water, air, and microorganisms.
            <p>Compsition:</p>Soil is made up of minerals, organic matter, water, air, and microorganisms. The mineral content of soil comes from bedrock, which is modified over time by physical, chemical, and biological processes. The organic matter in soil comes from plant, animal, and microbial residues in various stages of decomposition. 
            <p>Importance</p>
            Soil is vital to life on Earth. It provides a medium for plants to grow, a habitat for animals, and stores water. Soil also recycles nutrients, purifies water, and exchanges gases with the atmosphere. 
            <p>Formation</p>
            Soil is constantly forming, but at a very slow rate. One inch of topsoil can take several hundred years or more to develop. The rate of soil formation varies across the planet, with the slowest rates in cold, dry regions and the fastest rates in hot, wet regions. 
            <p>Threats to soil?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Erosion: The loss of topsoil through water, wind, or tillage. In 2011, 24 billion tonnes of fertile soil were lost to erosion.</li>
                <li>Salinization: The process by which soil becomes increasingly salty. Over one billion hectares of land are affected by salinization</li>
                <li>Nutrient imbalance: An unequal distribution of essential nutrients in the soil</li>
                <li>Soil contamination: The introduction of harmful substances into the soil. Common contaminants include pesticides, petroleum products, radon, asbestos, lead, chromated copper arsenate, and creosote. </li>
                <li>Urbanization: The occupation of prime lands for agriculture by landfills and other urban waste.</li>
                <li>Loss of biodiversity: A reduction in the quantity and variety of life forms in the soil.</li>
                <li>Soil organic carbon loss: The reduction in the amount of organic carbon in the soil.</li>
                <li>Compaction: The loss of soil structure.</li>
            </ul>
            Soil degradation can have many negative consequences, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers </li>
                <li>Clogged waterways </li>
                <li>Declines in fish and other species </li>
                <li>Worsened flooding </li>
                <li>Damage to infrastructure </li>
                <li>Negative effects on aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity </li>
                <li>Human health problems due to dust and particles in the air</li>
            </ul> </h1>
            <h1>Surveys and Case Studies</h1>
            <h1>Here are some case studies on soil pollution:
            Bhopal, India<br>
            A study found that soil in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh contained microplastics from various polymer classes. The study suggested that these microplastics could contaminate nearby groundwater, wetlands, and national parks. 
            Chennai, India<br>
            A study found that Chennai had the highest concentration of PCBs in soil among the cities studied. The study also found that the highest concentration was at an informal e-waste shredding site. 
            Visakhapatnam, India<br>
            A study found that the soil quality of agricultural and fallow land near Hindustan Zinc Limited was severely affected by industrial effluent. 
            Changzhou, China<br>
            A study found that the soil in the area of a fuel oil storage tank and lead smelting area was heavily polluted with Pb, Cd, and As. 
            Jeddah, Saudi Arabia<br>
            A study found that the indiscriminate disposal of hazardous waste was a significant source of soil contamination. The study also found that the concentration of metals was higher in areas closer to the source of pollution. 
            Volos<br>
            A study sampled soil from various green spaces, including parks, playgrounds, and parterres. The study also sampled areas near the port, train station, and bus stations.
            <p>Case Study in Soil Loss: Meadowview HOA Open Space, Temecula, CA</p>
            <center><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/blogs/6444/images/V1ZfdKTSwW1xc49Cd4ow_view-from-Muscle-Hill-NW.jpg"></center>
            In 2015, Ecology Artisans was hired by members of the Meadowview HOA for a preliminary site assessment of a 390-acre open space preserve in a suburban area of Temecula, CA in Riverside County. Our task was to examine existing and historical soil erosion conditions and prescribe treatment options.
            Unfortunately, much of this was kickstarted by the loss of a child's life while he played around unstable stream banks. The HOA also mentioned that plant and animal biodiversity had diminished, as well as trail stabilization and safety issues were arising. Our initial assessment noted that weed and fire abatement practices, in addition to concentrated storm runoff from the surrounding house and infrastructure development, was exacerbating soil loss in the open space areas. In addition, placement of trails, culvert construction and unauthorized encroachment/use has also contributed to the unzipping of the landscape. Scars of historical management of the open space were clearly visible. Deep discing furrows are visible all across the landscape, many of while run up and down slopes, furthering soil loss. Thankfully, discing ended about 10-years prior, followed by mowing. Due to costs, and damage, associated with mowing, the HOA experimented with sheep grazing to manage the land. This would have been beneficial, but the herd stocking and management seems to have been too many and for too long given the standing forage. In Summer 2016, we were brought on for a more thorough analysis and treatment identification for the site. Neil Bertrando and I set out to document the property to identify where soil erosion control was occurring and propose various treatments to stave off the loss and encourage soil retention, water infiltration and plant recruitment.

            Ways to tackle soil erosion/ conserve soil/prevent soil erosion
            <p>Mulching<br>
                A layer of material, like wood chips or straw, can be spread over the soil to protect it from wind and water erosion. Mulch can also help the soil retain moisture. </p>
            <p>Retaining walls<br>
                These can be built along slopes, around ponds and patios, or on flat ground. They can be an effective solution for controlling soil erosion.</p>
            <p>Contour canals<br>
                These can be dug across the flow of water to help control soil erosion by retaining runoff. </p>
            <p>Cover crops<br>
                These can be planted on hills to protect the ground from wind and rain erosion. Even if the above-ground plant parts freeze in the cooler season, the roots can help reinforce and retain the soil</p>
            <p>Crop rotation<br>
                This can help prevent eroded soil from washing into water bodies, which can reduce water pollution. Crop rotation can also reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides</p>
            <p>Permanent vegetation<br>
                This is considered the most permanent and effective way to control wind erosion. It protects the soil surface by reducing wind speed and preventing much of the direct wind force from reaching the soil particles.</p>
            <p>Ground cover<br>
                This can help prevent erosion and keep weeds out of your space</p>
